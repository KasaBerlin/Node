    Consistancy of code base 

runtime - Browser is a runtime. A place where the code is executed. 

asnychronous, non-blocking - Multiple users can make requests simultaneously

event-driven -- driven by events. Event handler + callback.

scalable - works just as well with 10 as 100000 people or files. Easy to maintain and grow or build an application.
